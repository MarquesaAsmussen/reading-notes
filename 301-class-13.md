## Reading Notes

### [When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

1. **What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?** - Personal computers were becoming more common in the home.

2. **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?** - Because professors began to expect that computer science majors would be familiar with computers. Also, parents were more likely to buy computers for boys than girls, so male CS students had an experiential advantage over female CS students.

### [Employee breakdown of key technology companies](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/)

**What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?**
  The industry is still...

1. majority male

2. majority white

3. there are a handful of companies with higher than average percentage of female employees, but even those are maximum 50%

4. it is also mentioned below the data that most companies do not disclose the ratio of laborers to execs, which could be skewing the data in a misleading way.

### [Why diversity matters to your tech company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

1. **When are diversity efforts most successful?** - "when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders"

2. **Why do diverse companies perform better?** - because people from varied backgrounds and upbringings will see problems differently and will contribute different solutions.

3. **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.** - a diverse company will be more likely to have employees, and therefore viewpoints, more representative of their user base. For example, an all-male or majority male company will likely not understand the perspective of thier female users as well as they could if there was a high female presence throughout the company.
