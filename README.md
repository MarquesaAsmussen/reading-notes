- What follows in these pages will be some of my notes, takeaways and "ah-ha!" moments from throughout my Code 102 course

### Growth Mindset

- **a comparison of "Growth" vs "Fixed" thinking**
- In his blog ["How you can benefit from a growth mindset"](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset), Steve Haffenden explores two patterns of thought-- one that leads to growth, develpoment and accomplishment, and another that lends itself to frustration, procrastination and abandoning tasks.

#### Reminders

- allow myself to ask/recognize, "Am I avoiding a task and losing focus because it has become difficult?"
- take a step back, breathe and when ready start to examine the challenge one bite at a time (especially by talking through the problem out loud, not just mentally)
- remember the "instant gratification monkey"
- acknowledge the "gumption trap"
- "The gumption trap: the phenomenon of knowing what needs to be done, but lacking the motivation to do it."
---Robert Persig, *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*
