## Choosing a Text Editor

### Features to look for in a good text editor:
- code completion *(makes like easier, writing quicker)*
- syntax highlighting *(easier to read/find errors)*
- theme variety *(eye strain)*
- lots of extension options *(should be able to scale up with you as your needs and abilities expand)*

### There are *many* text editors
- **Pre-installed options** -- *Text Edit* (Mac), *Notepad* (Windows), *Gedit/various others* (Linux)
 These are extremely basic. They *can* be used to make websites, but probably not the most efficient options. They will not feature code.
 
   If using these, remember: 
   1. Make sure it is in plain text with no other bold/italicize/etc options
   2. Create a folder on computer to store entire website, with additional pages in folders/sub-folders of main website
   3. Save files with correct extensions (HTML file as .html, CSS file as .css)

- **Third-Party Options** -- *NotePad++*(Windows), *TextWrangler/BB Edit*(Mac), *Visual Studio Code/VS Code*(Windows/Mac/Linux), *Atom*(Windows/Mac/Linux), *Brackets*(Windows/Mac/Linux), *SublimeText*(Windows/Mac/Linux)
 Some of these are free, some are paid or have free trials. All have many good features that will help stream-line the coding process. It is mosly a matter of preference/which features you need.
 
 ### Text Editors vs. IDEs
 
 -**Text Editor**: edits text, manages text, manages files
 -**IDE** *(Integrated Development Environment)*: suite of text editor, file manager, compiler and debugger softwares in one package. Not needed as a beginner, will be ready to use with more experience in normal text editor.
