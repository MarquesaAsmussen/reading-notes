## Choosing a Text Editor
*Document in your reading-notes the different classifications of text editors, and why itâ€™s important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code*

**Features to look for in a good text editor:**
- code completion *(makes like easier, writing quicker)*
- syntax highlighting *(easier to read/find errors)*
- theme variety *(eye strain)*
- lots of extension options *(should be able to scale up with you as your needs and abilities expand)*

There are *many* text editors
- Pre-installed options-- *Text Edit* (Mac), *Notepad* (Windows), *Gedit/various others* (Linux)
 These are extremely basic. They *can* be used to make websites, but probably not the most efficient options. They will not feature code.
   If using these, remember: 
 --1. Make sure it is in plain text with no other bold/italicize/etc options
 --2. Create a folder on computer to store entire website, with additional pages in folders/sub-folders of main website
 --3. Save files with correct extensions (HTML file as .html, CSS file as .css)
