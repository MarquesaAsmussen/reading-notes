# Day 1 of 401

## Readings: Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. _Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does:_ it iterates through an array and does a thing (whatever thing you specify it should do) for each item in that array.
2. _Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does:_ it goes through an array and does a thing (whatever thing you specify) and ends up with returning with only a single value.
3. _Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result_
   - _With normal Promise .then() syntax_
   - _Again with async / await syntax_
4. _Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student:_
5. _Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?:_ No, asynchronous is a particular kind of function that takes into account that the specific content it is asking for/returning may take some time to retrieve and allows for that time to pass without gumming up the works.

## Things I want to know more about

- ECMA script?

  - has to do with how JS is written and it's rules, etc
  - TypeScript?
    - allows us to use the extra levels of ambiguity/complexity that are ruled out by 'use strict'

- Runtimes
  - 'use strict'
  - require()
    - injects code ? don't understand this
