# Reading: Access Control (ACL)

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
   - **Basic** - Basic authentication is simple and convenient, but it is not secure. It should only be used to prevent unintentional access from non-malicious parties or used in combination with an encryption technology such as SSL
   - **Bearer** - can be used on a secure connection
1. **What does the JSON Web Token package do?**
   JSON Web Token (JWT) is a JSON encoded representation of a claim(s) that can be transferred between two parties. The claim is digitally signed by the issuer of the token, and the party receiving this token can later use this digital signature to prove the ownership on the claim

1. **What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?**
   - Do not put secret information in the payload or header elements of a JWT unless it is encrypted
   - you should not put secret information within a token (because contents of tokens are exposed)
