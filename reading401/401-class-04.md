## Readings: Data Modeling

1. _Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development_

   - significant decrease in defects for minimal additional effort
   - cost of initial setup work far out-weighed by overall benefit and reduced work in long run
   - potentially improves overall quality of code
     _taken from [TDD](<https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'tdd))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)>)_

1. _In what case would you need to use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` in a test suite?:_ to direct setup and tear down to your desired specifications.
1. _What is one downside of Test Driven Development:_ it's a slow process and add to the time to do even simple tasks
1. _What's the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?:_ ES6 classes adds "function" to their prototype and ensures the "this" refers to the object being created.
1. _Why REST?:_ it is flexible, lightweight [What is a RESTful API?](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)
