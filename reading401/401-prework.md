# Get Ready for 401

## Reading and Reference Materials

### _Read the following articles_

### [Solving Algorithmic Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

#### _As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3_

1. Read the problem completely twice. _can you explain the problem to someone else?_
1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
1. Optimize the manual steps.
1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
   _If you don’t know your programming language well enough to do the translation, you may need to brush up here on some basic constructs:_

   - Create a list
   - Sort a list or array
   - Create a map or dictionary
   - Loop through a list, or dictionary
   - Parse strings
   - Convert from string to int, int to string, etc

1. Optimize the real code.

   **Again, as much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3**

Have confidence in this process. The only way you are going to have confidence in this process is to practice it.
If you find that a problem itself involves multiple large steps or is very complicated, **“divide and conquer”** (find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then following the process above for each half). Think, "If I already knew 'x', the rest would be easy", then divide at that point.

Practice skills at:

- [Codility](https://www.codility.com/)
- [Simple Programmer](https://simpleprogrammer.com/so-you-want-to-become-a-better-programmer-topcoder/)

### [Act like you make $1000/hr](https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d)

- Essentially, when you hold your time as highly valuable, you will find it easier (if not essential) to say no to more things. It will allow you be more productive by bringing an awareness of how much time is being spent on tasks, thus providing the opportunity to become more efficient.

### [How to think like a programmer](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)

1. Understand the problem: you'll know you understand the problem when you can explain it in plain english (say to a non-programmer or rubber duck)
1. Plan the Solution: use comments to write out pseudocode for each step that needs to happen
1. Divide: chop up big problems into smaller problems and solve each one, starting with the easiest.
1. Stuck?: try to be more curious (rather than irritated) about where it's going wrong. step through the solution to find where it is failing, then reassess. Research if needed.
1. Practice: The more problems you solve, the better you will become at implementing this process.

### [The 5 Whys](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures

## Things I want to know more about

- define: "corner case" and "edge case"
- operand "+="
- also operand "<-" (or is it "<="? whatever the backwards arrow was that Jacob did in example code challenge pseudocode)
- why is it "i++" for wards, but only "i-" to go backwards?
