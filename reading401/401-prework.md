# Get Ready for 401

## Reading and Reference Materials

### _Read the following articles_

### [Solving Algorithmic Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

#### _As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3_

1. Read the problem completely twice. _can you explain the problem to someone else?_
1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
1. Optimize the manual steps.
1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
   _If you don’t know your programming language well enough to do the translation, you may need to brush up here on some basic constructs:_

   - Create a list
   - Sort a list or array
   - Create a map or dictionary
   - Loop through a list, or dictionary
   - Parse strings
   - Convert from string to int, int to string, etc

1. Optimize the real code.

   **Again, as much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3**

Have confidence in this process. The only way you are going to have confidence in this process is to practice it.
If you find that a problem itself involves multiple large steps or is very complicated, **“divide and conquer”** (find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then following the process above for each half). Think, "If I already knew 'x', the rest would be easy", then divide at that point.

## Things I want to know more about

- define: "corner case" and "edge case"
- operand "+="
- also operand "<-" (or is it "<="? whatever the backwards arrow was that Jacob did in example code challenge pseudocode)
- why is it "i++" for wards, but only "i-" to go backwards?
