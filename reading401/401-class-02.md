# Day 2 of 401

## Readings: Express

1. _What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?:_

   **PUT** updates the full resource
   **PATCH** does a partial resource

2. _Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server:_
   - [mocky](https://designer.mocky.io/)
   - [fakeJSON](https://fakejson.com/)
   - [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
3. _Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?:_
   - APIDoc.js is a RESTful web API Documentation Generator
   - The Swagger command-line provides Swagger utilities and project lifecycle support
4. _Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST:_
   **SOAP**(_Simple Object Access Protocol_): "a protocol which was designed before REST and came into the picture. The main idea behind designing SOAP was to ensure that programs built on different platforms and programming languages could exchange data in an easy manner."
   **ReST**(_Representational State Transfer_): "designed specifically for working with components such as media components, files, or even objects on a particular hardware device. Any web service that is defined on the principles of REST can be called a RestFul web service. A Restful service would use the normal HTTP verbs of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE for working with the required components."

   SOAP is a protocol, ReST is an architectural structure.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**_Web Server_** _On the hardware side_, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files. (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files) A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.
_On the software side_, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device. [What is a web server?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server)

**_Express_** "ExpressJS is a web application framework that provides you with a simple API to build websites, web apps and back ends. With ExpressJS, you need not worry about low level protocols, processes, etc. It provides a minimal interface to build our applications. It provides us the tools that are required to build our app. It is flexible as there are numerous modules available on npm, which can be directly plugged into Express." [What is Express?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/expressjs/expressjs_overview.htm)

**_Routing_** Routing or router in web development is a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them. To put simply, in the Router you determine what should happen when a user visits a certain page. [WHAT IS: ROUTING](https://divpusher.com/glossary/routing/)

**_WRRC_** Is the Web Request Response Cycle. It refers to the process by which a client reaches out to a server for a resource, via HTTP request
