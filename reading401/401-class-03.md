1. _True or false: The route handler is middleware?:_ True, it can be
1. _In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?:_ by sending a response method, like those below

   | Method           | Description                                                                           |

   | res.jsonp()      | Send a JSON response with JSONP support.                                              |
   | res.redirect()   | Redirect a request.                                                                   |

1. _At what point in the request lifecycle can you "inject" middleware?:_ before a request is processed <!-- honestly not sure if this is correct -->
1. _What can cause express to error with "Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response":_
