### [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

1. What is functional programming?
   - a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
   - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
   - It does not cause any observable side effects
   - It returns the same result if given the same arguments
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
   - The code is easier to test.
4. What is immutability?
   - When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.
5. What is Referential transparency?
   - if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
