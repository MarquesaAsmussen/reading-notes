### [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/)

**What is a ‘call’?** function invocation

**How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?** since it is "single",calls are done one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is "synchronous".

**What does LIFO mean?** LIFO: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

**Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.**

**What causes a Stack Overflow?** "A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error."

### [JavaScript error messages](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)

**What is a ‘refrence error’?** trying to use a variable that is not yet declared gets this type of errors.

**What is a ‘syntax error’?** something cannot be parsed in terms of syntax

**What is a ‘range error’?** manipulating an object with some kind of length and giving it an invalid length throws this kind of error.

**What is a ‘type error’?** types you are trying to use or access (number, string and so on) are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

**What is a breakpoint?** a plce in the code that you as the programmer specify to deliberately break the code in order to examine what is happening at that point.

**What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?** creates a breakpoint at the specified line.
