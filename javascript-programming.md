## [Expressions and Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)

### Operators

**operator** : JavaScript has the following types of operators.

* Assignment operators
  * Return value and chaining
  * Destructuring
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
  * Bitwise logical operators
  * Bitwise shift operators
  * Logical operators
  * Short-circuit evaluation
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
  * delete
  * typeof
  * void
* Relational operators
  * in
  * instanceof

#### Operator precedence

A detailed table, complete with links to additional details about each operator, may be found [here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table)

### Expressions

**expression** : any valid unit of code that resolves to a value. JavaScript has the following expression categories:

* Arithmetic
* String
* Logical
* Primary expressions
* Left-hand-side expressions

#### Primary expressions

Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.

* this

##### Grouping operator

The grouping operator ( ) controls the precedence of evaluation in expressions. For example, you can override multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction to evaluate addition first.

#### Left-hand-side expressions

Left values are the destination of an assignment.

* new
* super

## [Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#function_declarations)

**function** : A function in JavaScript is ****similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.
*To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.*

### JavaScript function syntax

A JS function is defined with the *function* keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

* Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

* Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

* Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

### Function invocation

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

* When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)

* When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code

* Automatically (self invoked)

### Function Return

When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

### The () operator invokes the function

If you don't remember the "()", will just give you back the function object, rather than the function result you were looking for.

### Functions Used as Variable Values

Instead of using a variable to store the return value of a function:

* let x = toCelsius(77);
* let text = "The temperature is " + x + " Celsius";

You can use the function directly, as a variable value:

* let text = "The temperature is " + toCelsius(77) + " Celsius";

### Local Variables

> *"What happens in the function, stays in the function."*

Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become **LOCAL** to the function. Local variables can *only* be accessed from within the function.

>// code here can NOT use carName
>
>function myFunction() {
>let carName = "Volvo";
>// code here CAN use carName
>}
>
>// code here can NOT use carName

*Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.*

Local variables are **created** when a function starts, and **deleted** when the function is completed.

### Defining functions

#### Function declarations

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

* The name of the function.
* A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
* The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

#### Function expressions

### Calling functions

Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.

### Function scope

### Scope and the function stack

#### Nested functions and closures

#### Preservation of variables

#### Multiply-nested functions

#### Name conflicts

### Closures

### Using the arguments object

### Function parameters

#### Default parameters

##### Without default parameters (pre-ECMAScript 2015)

##### With default parameters (post-ECMAScript 2015)

#### Rest parameters

### Arrow functions

#### Shorter functions

#### No separate "this"

### Predefined functions

JavaScript has several top-level, built-in functions:

**eval()**
The eval() method evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string.

**uneval()**
The uneval() method creates a string representation of the source code of an Object.

**isFinite()**
The global isFinite() function determines whether the passed value is a finite number. If needed, the parameter is first converted to a number.

**isNaN()**
The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN or not. Note: coercion inside the isNaN function has interesting rules; you may alternatively want to use Number.isNaN(), as defined in ECMAScript 2015, or you can use typeof to determine if the value is Not-A-Number.

**parseFloat()**
The parseFloat() function parses a string argument and returns a floating point number.

**parseInt()**
The parseInt() function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix (the base in mathematical numeral systems).

**decodeURI()**
The decodeURI() function decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI or by a similar routine.

**decodeURIComponent()**
The decodeURIComponent() method decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component previously created by encodeURIComponent or by a similar routine.

**encodeURI()**
The encodeURI() method encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).

**encodeURIComponent()**
The encodeURIComponent() method encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two "surrogate" characters).

**escape()**
The deprecated escape() method computes a new string in which certain characters have been replaced by a hexadecimal escape sequence. Use encodeURI or encodeURIComponent instead.

**unescape()**
The deprecated unescape() method computes a new string in which hexadecimal escape sequences are replaced with the character that it represents. The escape sequences might be introduced by a function like escape. Because unescape() is deprecated, use decodeURI() or decodeURIComponent instead.

## [Control Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow)

**control flow** : the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
