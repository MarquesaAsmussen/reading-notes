## What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** : "a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions."
[MDN Web Docs: CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

   Or, in the Common Tongue ðŸ˜‰ : a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look atâ€”displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, or moreâ€”you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.[MDN Web Docs: JavaScript â€” Dynamic client-side scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

## Input and Output in JS

Creating applications via HTML is cumbersome and difficult to read. The solution to this was to create templating engines.
Basically, a "template" would be an **HTML snippet** with some **place holders** and then a **function call** that gets the HTML snippet (the template) as a **parameter**, and gets several key-value pairs. The function then returns a *new* **HTML snippet** in which the **place holders** were *replaced* by the value of the appropriate key.

## JavaScript Terms

**variable** :  a container for storing data (values).

>*ex.*:
>var x = 5;
>var y = 6;
>var z = x + y;

From the example above, you can expect:

* x stores the value 5
* y stores the value 6
* z stores the value 11

**identifier** : unique names to identify JS variables. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

* Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
* Names must begin with a letter
* Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
* Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
* Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

**assignment operator** : the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
  *"equal to"* is written *"=="* in JS

**declaring variables** : creating a variable is called "declaring".
You can use "var", "let", or "const" (var carName;). After the declaration, the variable has the value of "undefined".
  *It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script*

  __*undefined*__ : varibles can be declared w/o a value, and wouldhave the value *"undefined"*. After the execution of a statement, a variable will be undefined.

  **redeclaring** : if a variable is redeclared, it will not lose it's value.
    *ex.*
    var carName = "Volvo";
    var carName;

### JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript variables can hold **numbers** like 100 and text values like **"John Doe"**.

In programming, text values are called text __*"strings"*__.

*Strings are written inside double ("") or single ('') quotes. Numbers are written without quotes. If you put a number in quotes ('5' or 'five'), it will be treated as a text string.*

### JavaScript Arithmetic

As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and +:

* You can also add strings (""), but strings will be concatenated.
  *If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.*
