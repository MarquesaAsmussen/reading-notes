## Readings: Project Ideas

### [API Repos](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)

### Ideas

- Travel: an app that curates best places and restaurants to visit so you don't just see the standard tourist-y stuff

- Food: an app that narrows down options to only highly rated and budget friendly places, rather than the infinite options of yelp

- Automotive: My partner had an idea for a site that unifies information and pricing for cars.
