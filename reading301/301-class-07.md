### [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
   - a smart dude who helped to write the HTTP protocol and did research on how the internet works
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

   - because they weren't designed with that outcome in mind-- the web was, but the techniques the subsequent devs used only had the requirement of small groups in mind.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

   - it is a general purpose protocol that applies "verbs" to "nouns"; it allows the same "verbs" (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) to all of the "nouns" (URLs).

4. What does a GET do?

   -

5. What does a POST do?

6. What does PUT do?

7. What does PATCH do?
